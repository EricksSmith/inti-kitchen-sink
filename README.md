# kitchen-sink
An everything-and-the-kitchen-sink theme for the Inti Foundation WordPress parent theme

## Description
The Kitchen Sink theme is an example child theme for Inti Foundation. This child theme overrides the core Foundation 6 files from the parent theme library, as well as the ´_settings.scss´ file. By replacing the library directory, you can keep your theme's version of Foundation distinct from that of the parent theme, implement your own settings file and define its values, and recompile everything with Gulp will still making use of Inti Foundation's WordPress framework.

To make use of Inti Foundation's features as well as its styles and Foundation settings, please refer to the other example theme, <a href="https://github.com/waqastudios/inti-basic-starter">Basic Starter</a>
